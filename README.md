# Graph Neural Networks & Concepts from Scratch

This repository collects from-scratch explorations of graph-focused machine learning: graph neural networks, message-passing frameworks, community detection algorithms, and classical graph analytics. Everything here aims to be minimal, transparent, and easy to extend.

## Scope
- Hand-built implementations of graph learning building blocks (encoders, aggregators, pooling layers)
- Baseline community-detection and representation-learning pipelines for benchmarking
- Experiment notes that explain design choices, pitfalls, and empirical results

## Repository Layout
- `graph_neural_networks_and_concepts_from_scratch/` – working implementations, experiments, and utilities
- `stanford-course-pack/` – scratch space for re-implementing ideas inspired by the Stanford material listed below

## Resources
- Stanford 2018 Graph Neural Networks / CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs (lecture series + reference material)
- "Graph Representation Learning" by William L. Hamilton (2020)
- "Community Detection in Graphs" by Santo Fortunato, Physics Reports 486 (2009)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and open the notebooks or scripts inside `graph_neural_networks_and_concepts_from_scratch/`.
2. Drop experiment notes or Stanford-inspired re-implementations inside `stanford-course-pack/` to keep them organized.
3. Document new ideas in the README as the project grows so future readers can follow the progression.
